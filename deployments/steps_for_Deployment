- Create the deployment:
	kuberctl create -f filename.yaml

- Describe the deployment:
	kubectl describe deploy deployment_name

- Get deployment:
	kubectl get deploy

- There are two ways to upgrade the deployment:
	1. Using kubectl "set" command:

		kubectl set image deploy deployment_name container_name=image_name:image_version


	2. Using kubectl "edit" command:

		KUBE_EDITOR="nano" kubectl edit deploy deployment_name

	Here, we are using nano editor to edit the document.

- We can also check the rollout changes history:

	kubectl rollout history deployment/deployment_name

- We can also check the status of rollouts:

	kubectl rollout status deployment/deployment_name

- We can also scale up and scale down the deployments:
 
	kubectl scale deployment deployment_name --replicas=count
